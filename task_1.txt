According to the client's requirements, I created a new web page (with new url sub-route) within the project. This page contains a data-table with several columns. The data table provides various functionality, e.g. searching, sorting, filtering, moving columns, selecting columns. After the column is selected, and a specific button is clicked - a modal window gets opened, where the user provides some parameters and submits. This initiates a network request to backend, where specific logic is implemented.
